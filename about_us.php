      <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
      <h1>Likha School Supplies is a newly established shop in Manila, Philippines that offers low-cost educational commodities to customers. It gained its popularity due to its convenience, especially now during a pandemic when everything is done online. They provide a wide range of school supplies needed for the students in town that are very high-quality despite their cheap selling price. Aside from that, they also focus on the services they offer, constantly improving and maintaining their highest standard of customer service. The people behind this create programs for the development and overall advancement of the shop. Part of their objective is to support and bring knowledge to those students within their reach, particularly the underprivileged ones, through education empowerment.
          Likha School Supplies is owned by a group of young entrepreneurs who aspired to be successful in life at an early age. These individuals cultivate mutually beneficial relationships for the welfare and progress of the company, and all of their efforts are concentrated on supplying their customers with high-quality tools that will accompany them in their success.
